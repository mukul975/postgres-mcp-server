## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the PostgreSQL MCP Server, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainer via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
2. **Do NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities
3. **Include** as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial Response**: You'll receive an initial response within 72 hours
- **Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing

### Security Best Practices

When using this MCP server:

1. **Database Security**:
   - Use strong, unique passwords for database connections
   - Implement proper database user permissions (principle of least privilege)
   - Use SSL/TLS for database connections in production
   - Regularly update PostgreSQL to the latest secure version

2. **Environment Security**:
   - Store database credentials in environment variables, never in code
   - Use `.env` files for local development (already in .gitignore)
   - Regularly rotate database passwords
   - Monitor database access logs

3. **Network Security**:
   - Restrict database network access to necessary hosts only
   - Use firewall rules to limit database port access
   - Consider using connection pooling and rate limiting

4. **MCP Server Security**:
   - Run the server with minimal required permissions
   - Regularly update dependencies (`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`)
   - Monitor server logs for suspicious activity
   - Use process isolation in production environments

## Security Features

This MCP server includes several security features:

- **Query Validation**: Only allows specific SQL query types
- **Parameter Sanitization**: Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Connection Management**: Proper connection pooling with cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- **Permission Respect**: Honors database user permissions and access controls

## Vulnerability Response Process

1. **Assessment**: We evaluate the severity and impact
2. **Development**: We develop and test a fix
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing in isolated environments
4. **Release**: Security patch released with version bump
5. **Notification**: Users notified via GitHub releases and security advisories
6. **Documentation**: Security advisory published with details and mitigation

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate patch release (within 24-48 hours)
- **High**: Patch release within 7 days
- **Medium**: Included in next regular release
- **Low**: Included in next regular release with documentation

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate security researchers and users who help keep this project secure by responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities.
